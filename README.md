# The first browser based software loopstation

## Introduction :wave:
Soundcycle is an open source software loopstation which runs entirely in your browser. It aims to be easy to use and accessible for everyone.

__Note:__ It's now a long time ago since I started developing Soundcycle. I wanted to open source it earlier, but until now I didn't have time to. I hope that people like YOU can bring Soundcycle to another level, since I don't have time to do all of it alone!

## How to use it :musical_note:
Navigate to [soundcycle.scriptify.tech](https://soundcycle.scriptify.tech)

Here's a tutorial video describing the funtionality of Soundcycle. Since not all of the planned funtionality is fully working, not everything is shown in the video. This is something which has to be done yet!

__Note:__ If you have created something you want to share with other with Soundcycle, contact me (or issue a pull request) and I'll add it here.

__Note:__ Until now I've just used and developed Soundcycle with newer versions of Chrome. Browser support is something which has to be clarified yet (if you look a the [TODO list](/TODOs.md)). So I can't guarantee that it will work in your favourite browser. The same applies to mobile devices.

## Motivation :runner:
The motivation for this project is a really personal one. I am a passionate beatboxer and I was always fascinated about loopstations. But since loopstations aren't that cheap to afford and everyone of us has a pretty suitable piece of hardware at home (I mean your computer) I thought: "Hey, why don't I try to create one myself?"
This is how everything started. And as I am really interested into Web Technologies I decided to create the whole thing as a Web application. Technically seen, this isn't the best choice I've ever made, but I think that it is a really interesting experiment.
The project started out as school project, but now I would like to continue it with YOU.
