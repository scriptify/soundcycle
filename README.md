# The first browser based software loopstation

## What is Soundcycle? :wave:
Soundcycle is an open source software loopstation which runs entirely in your browser. It aims to be easy to use and accessible for everyone.

__Note:__ It's now a long time ago since I started developing Soundcycle. I wanted to open source it earlier, but until now I didn't have time to. I hope that people like YOU can bring Soundcycle to another level, since I don't have time to do all of it alone!

Read the article on Medium I've written about Soundcycle:

## Using it :musical_note:
Navigate to [https://scriptify.github.io/soundcycle/](https://scriptify.github.io/soundcycle/) to see it in the wild.

It may look like this when you create a song:

Here are some example songs I recorded with Soundcycle:
....

For recording, I've used the Steinberg UR22 audio interface.

__Note:__ If you have created something with Soundcycle you want to share with others, contact me (or issue a pull request) and I'll add it here.

__Another note:__ Until now I've just used and developed Soundcycle with newer versions of Chrome. Browser support is something which has to be clarified yet (if you look a the [TODO-list](/TODOs.md)). So I can't guarantee that it will work in your favourite browser. The same applies to mobile devices.

__Yet another note:__ TBH, this sections needs some drasticals improvements. But as my time is limited, I'll keep ist simple for now. But a detailed explaination of all features is planned here.

## Why? :runner:
The motivation for this project is a really personal one. I am a passionate beatboxer and I was always fascinated about loopstations. But since loopstations aren't that cheap to afford and everyone of us has a pretty suitable piece of hardware at home (I mean your computer), I thought: "Hey, why don't I try to create one myself?"
This is how everything started. And as I am really interested into web technologies, I decided to implement a web application. Technically seen, this isn't the best choice I've ever made, but I think that it is a really interesting experiment. And I think this project could become much more than just an experiment.

The project started out as school project, but now I would like to continue it with YOU, as I am not able to do that alone.
